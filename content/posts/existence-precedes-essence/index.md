L'existence précède l'essence (simplified to “Existence precedes essence”).

“We are facing an existence known as ae, created from our personal data. Ae’s existence evolves and grows based on such data, and can autonomously think without our judgment. A virtual counterpart is growing together within people’s memories and records. This is called ae.”

Since life has no predefined patterns or characteristics from birth, essence comes afterward without inheritance, relying only on actions and choices.
