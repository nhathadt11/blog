Physical effects such as g-force cannot be experienced in simulation but during real flights. The same thing happens when going upstairs or downstairs in an elevator: body weight changes and the brain informs me when the change is sudden during acceleration and deceleration. This signal can be used to detect vertical speed (VS) changes during a real flight.

Very accurate 3D models of Shanghai, manually built by the community, sits on top of the mesh scenery. They look so realistic.
