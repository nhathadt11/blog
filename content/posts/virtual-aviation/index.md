Physical effects such as g-force cannot be experienced at home but during real flights. The same thing happens when going upstairs in an elevator: body weight changes and the brain informs me when the change is sudden during acceleration and deceleration. This signal can be used to detect vertical speed (VS) changes during a real flight.
