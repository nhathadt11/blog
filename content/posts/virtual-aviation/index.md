Physical effects such as g-force cannot be experienced at home, but I do during real flights. The same thing happens when going upstairs in an elevator: body weight changes and the brain informs me when the change is sudden change during acceleration and deceleration. I usually use this signal to detect vertical speed (VS) changes during a real flight.
