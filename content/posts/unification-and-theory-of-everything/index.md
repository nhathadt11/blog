There are things that I don't know in detail yet, but a hierarchical organization connects all things and make it easier to memorize, understand, and navigate through them. Physics is a great framework to explore the world around us and unlock the mysteries of the universe. It is heavily based on mathematics to describe physical phenomena and can serve as a tool to understand many other fields of science. Also, insights into technological capabilities and limitations can be provided from a physical perspective. Super interesting!
