Today's digital literacy (数字素养) discovered an MV of TWICE called SCIENTIST.

In the video, you will see an equation repeatedly appearing in many scenes and named the Formula of LOVE which is written as O + T = <3.

It is explained as a close-knit relationship between TWICE and their fandom - ONCE like "needle and thread". And it semantically means ONCE + TWICE = LOVE (OMG amazingly cute).

Mathematically, O + T = <3 can be translated as 1 + 2 = <3 or 1 + 2 <= 3 also results in a correct inequality. It turns out Formula of Love: O+T=<3 is the third album of the group.

今天通过数字素养发现了一个TWICE的视频 SCIENTIST。

视频里你会看见一个出现很多次的等式。它就是Formula of LOVE（爱情的等式）O + T = <3。

网络社区认为，TWICE和粉丝们的关系非常亲密。也就是说ONCE + TWICE = LOVE（我的天，太可爱了）。

O + T = <3用数字方法来翻译成1 + 2 = <3或1 + 2 <= 3，1 + 2 <= 3也是一个正确的不等式。原来Formula of Love: O+T=<3是TWICE的第三的音乐专辑。

이제부터는 MV 즐길 일만 남았네요.
