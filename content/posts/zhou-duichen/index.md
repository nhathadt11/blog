I have created poems in several different languages that I have learned. Here is a Chinese one called Axial Symmetry (轴对称). It does not strictly comply with the traditional rules of Chinese poetry.

九月九日 (Jiǔ yuè jiǔ rì) - September 9\
宇宙发光 (Yǔzhòu fāguāng) - Cosmic glow\
秒短分长 (Miǎo duǎn fēn zhǎng) - Seconds short, minutes long\
变个月饼 (Biàn gè yuèbǐng) - Turn into a moon cake\
送给大家 (Sòng gěi dàjiā) - Give it to everyone\
中秋快乐 (Zhōngqiū kuàilè) - Happy Mid-Autumn Festival\
九月十日 (Jiǔ yuè shí rì) - September 10

The concept behind this poem's creation is that I have taken the middle sentence to serve as the x-axis, arranging sentences symmetrically along the y-axis. It does not take a specific shape, instead, it acts as a framework for words to fill. The lower section (negative y) suggests the reason for the occurrence of the upper section (positive y).
