I have created several poems in different languages that I have learned. Here is a Chinese one called Mid-Autumn Axial Symmetry (中秋节的轴对称). It does not strictly comply with the traditional rules of Chinese poetry, though.

九月九日 (Jiǔ yuè jiǔ rì) - September 9\
月亮发光 (Yuèliàng fāguāng) - The Moon glows\
秒短分长 (Miǎo duǎn fēn zhǎng) - Seconds short, minutes long\
变个月饼 (Biàn gè yuèbǐng) - Turn into a moon cake\
送给大家 (Sòng gěi dàjiā) - Gift it to everyone\
中秋快乐 (Zhōngqiū kuàilè) - Happy Mid-Autumn Festival\
九月十日 (Jiǔ yuè shí rì) - September 10

The concept behind this poem's creation is that I have taken the middle phrase to serve as the x-axis, arranging phrases and sentences symmetrically with respect to the phrase. It does not take a symmetry-specific shape, instead, it acts as a framework for words to fill. The lower section (negative y) suggests the reason for the occurrence of the upper section (positive y).

The starting point, the phrase 变个月饼, actually originated from the writing of a Chinese friend; she wrote 变个艺术.
