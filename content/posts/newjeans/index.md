几天前韩国的一个朋友推荐了这个全新女团NewJeans뉴진스。她们在正式出道日上表演了第一首主打歌Attention。其余的歌曲包括Hurt、Hype boy和Cookie。

New是新的意思，Jeans的衣服表达现代人划时代的精神。NewJeans和New Genes的发音区别不太大，可能表示成为「New Genes」或者「New Generation」的决心。

NewJeans的歌曲都很好听，突然发现这一首特别好，MV Hype boy，如下。

A few days ago, a Korean friend recommended the emerging girl group NewJeans 뉴진스. They made their official debut with their first title song, Attention. The other featured tracks are Hurt, Cookie, and Hype Boy.

The name "NewJeans" is quite interesting, as it combines "New" with "Jeans" symbolizing the forward-thinking spirit of modern times. The similarity in pronunciation between "NewJeans" and "New Genes" suggests their aspiration to be the "New Genes" or the "New Generation."

While all of NewJeans' songs are melodious, the MV for Hype Boy has particularly caught my attention.
