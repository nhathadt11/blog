The lighter elements are made up in the fusion process that exists in the core of the stars. What about the heavier element?

There are a few little neutrons and an iron nucleus. This seed nucleus is getting bombarded with these neutrons, and then it is going to swell and turn into a much larger nucleus â‡’ radioactive and neutron-rich. It is an isotope.

Because it is radioactive, it does not like to stay in this way. In fact, it will all the neutrons are converted into protons. And we end up with a stable element that is much larger than the original iron. It could be a carbon atom or uranium.

An example of uranium 238 is technically not a stable element (half-life is 4.7b years). For humans, it is stable but on cosmic timescales, it is not.

The above process so-called neutron capture process. There are 2 ways of neutron capture process: slow n-capture and rapid n-capture. They refer to how fast what timescale this neutron bombardment is occurring.

For the slow n-capture, the timescale is about 10,000 years. And what happens is that in evolved red giant stars. The n-capture process happens for many times until the heaviest element is formed, called Pb.
