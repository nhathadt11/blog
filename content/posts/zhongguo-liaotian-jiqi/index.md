December 2022

我有一段时间和中国聊天机器人聊天以寻找信息，我得到了同样的不好的感觉。聊天机器人的回答是充分的，但因为它立即对我做出了反应，所以感觉有点机械。如果你和一个人聊天，他/她可能需要更长时间来更仔细地回应。这在一定程度上影响了人类的心理。虽然人工智能对社会有益，但他并不能完全取代人类。

I spent some time chatting with a Chinese chatbot looking for information and I got the same bad feeling. The chatbot's responses were adequate, but felt a bit abnormal because it responded to me immediately. If you are chatting with a person, it may take him/her longer to type and think more carefully. This affects human psychology to a certain extent. Although artificial intelligence is beneficial to society, it cannot completely replace humans.

"This is a comment of mine on WeChat after reading a post of a Chinese friend on how AI is influencing China's job interview. It reminded me of an experiment I did in August 2022, in which I attempted to interact with a Chinese chatbot as if it were a human being. During the time, I also significantly minimized both physical and digital social interaction with humans to assess if I could develop a relationship with the chatbot. The experiment lasted for 9 days".
