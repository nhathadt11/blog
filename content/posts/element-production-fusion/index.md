Why does the Sun shine? Nuclear fusion from H to Fe

{{< figure src="posts/element-production-fusion/images/image1.png" title="Star core" >}}

What is actually happening is that 4 atoms of Hydrogen come together in a series of steps that we are going to leave out for now, they form a helium atom. That is made from 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So we have some conversion of 4 protons into 2 neutrons into 1 Helium. This works because there is quantum mechanical tunneling going on. The 4 positively charged protons would actually repel themselves.

Because this tunneling effect it is hot enough so that these protons can be eventually combined into 1 helium nucleus.

If we weigh 1 He atom and (2n+2p) separately we would find out that 1He < (2n+2p) around ~0.73% (mass defect) and the energy released as the popular equation showed E=mc^2. For atoms that are heavier than iron, we actually need to put energy in to make the fusion process happen.

In the end, the star ends up with an iron core. These fusion processes have been going on in the center and growing larger and larger as more and more elements are being made. And eventually, there is a big, fat Iron core sitting there. And since it canâ€™t get energy out anymore, the star has a big problem because it needs to have an energy source. And so without that, it explodes as a supernova.

It is really nice how nuclear physics and astrophysics can come together because nuclear physics governs what is happening inside the core and then the astrophysics provides what we can actually observe. And putting these two together we can understand how stellar evolution. That is actually governed by the nuclear physics processes, specifically fusion, in the core.

By measuring the luminosity of a star as well as its temperature we can place it on this diagram and then learn which evolutionary state the star is in, which tells us what is going on in its core.
