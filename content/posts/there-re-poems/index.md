My reading categories are mostly about technology and engineering. I randomly picked up a book about digital writing and just read it. The book is more about literature. I was also skimming many samples on the internet to reflect what I read.

The main idea that was pointed out and many samples of the content on the internet share the same thing. It is to use the sound of words to create syllabic beats and the content that the writing is supposed to deliver to the audience.

The book and samples are written in Vietnamese. I wanted to give it a try in English.

> When writing content, phonetics comes first, semantics comes second\
> That’s why every language is beautiful\
> When writing code, imagination comes first, experience comes second\
> That’s why every software has bugs
>

For the first two lines, a language indeed represents a country’s culture. A language always has a phonetic part describing how the word is sounded and a semantic part describing the meaning it represents.

The last two lines represent the idea of coding. At a glance of reading a code fragment, you will just guess what the code does through the function name and a few lines of logic. If you are lacking experience with the code, you may fail to understand exactly what it does and introduce some bugs.

Another is about the COVID pandemic.

> Saigon, COVID is coming 😭\
> I can’t just be sitting and doing nothing 😢\
> But there's nothing I can do rather than coding 🤣\
> To see how e-commerce is growing 🥳\
> 当66和618合在一起就创建一个新的意思66618（溜溜溜又八）
>

The first 4 lines are intended to form a poem addressing feelings and may evoke other’s feelings as well. The last line is a practice of using Chinese homophones in internet slang. And Chinese people tend to use numbers over the character as long as they have the same phonetics when they do chatting.

6.6 and 6.18 are the two sale dates in the China e-commerce world, especially 6.18, which is the Mid-year Grand promotion. If you notice putting these two dates together would create a new meaning, 66618, is literal to “you are awesome and rich”.

> Linking things makes better comprehension and memorization.
> 

Many digital posts added some emojis to make some lines more noticeable. This should be helpful. I wanted to raise people up. So I appended some to the end to reflect the emotion of each line with the hope they positively affect the people. It cannot make the COVID situation get better in reality, but at least the human mental state will be.

> Happiness is the difference between two emotional values that result in a positive value. Even if these two values are both negative.

*These were created during the COVID pandemic in late 2020 and mid 2021.*
